# End-to-End Exploit

This directory contains the Phoenix end-to-end exploit, as described in ยง7.3 of our paper. The exploit triggers bit flips in page-table entries and is based on [Rubicon](https://github.com/comsec-group/rubicon).

## Prerequisites

See the prerequisites of the [PC Proof-of-Concept](../poc/README.md).

The exploit was tested with a single-rank DIMM (H11 of Table 5 in the paper).

## Building

Generate the build files and compile (Release, Unix Makefiles):

```bash
# Generate build files and compile (Release, Unix Makefiles)
make build
```

## Running

Run the exploit with our predetermined parameters (see [`run_exploit.sh`](./run_exploit.sh) for details):

```bash
# Run the exploit
make run
```
